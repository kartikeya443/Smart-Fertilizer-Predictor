# Smart Fertilizer Predictor | Data Science Project

## Introduction
It optimizes fertilizer use by taking user input like NPK levels, land size, crop type, and soil conditions. Using machine learning on real-time datasets, it provides tailored fertilizer recommendations, promoting sustainable farming, improving crop yield, and increasing farmer income with a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Overview

1. Web Portal: User-friendly web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) collects user inputs such as NPK levels, land size, crop type, season, and soil type.
2. Data Used: Real-time datasets sourced from Kaggle and government databases on crop, soil, and fertilizer information.
3. Model Training: Machine learning model (Logistic Regression) built using Scikit-learn and trained on the cleaned dataset to classify fertilizer recommendations.
4. Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, cleaning, and handling numerical computations.
5. Fertilizer Prediction: Based on user input, the model predicts the amount and type of fertilizer required, optimizing sustainable farming practices.
6. Backend Logic: Powered by Python Flask, ensuring smooth processing of requests and communication between the front end and machine learning model.
